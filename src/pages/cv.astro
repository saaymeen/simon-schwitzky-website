							Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr themes and tumbled head
							first into the rabbit hole of coding and web development. Fast-forward to today, and I’ve
							had the privilege of building software for an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge
							corporation, and a digital product studio.
							<br /><br />
							My main focus these days is building accessible user interfaces for our customers at Klaviyo.
							I most enjoy building software in the sweet spot where design and engineering meet — things that
							look good but are also built well under the hood. In my free time, I've also released an online
							video course that covers everything you need to know to build a web app with the Spotify API.
							<br /><br />
							When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually rock climbing, reading, hanging out with my wife and
							two cats, or running around Hyrule searching for Korok seeds Korok seeds.
